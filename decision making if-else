Example 1

Sample Input 1
15
Sample Output 1
Safe for outdoor activities
Explanation
  The given temperature is 15 degrees Celsius, which is above zero. Hence, the output is "Safe for outdoor activities."
Program:
import java.util.*;
public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int a=sc.nextInt();
		
		//Simple if 
		if(a>0){
		    System.out.println("Safe for Outdoor Activities");
		}
		else{
		    System.out.println("Too Cold for Outdoor Activities");
